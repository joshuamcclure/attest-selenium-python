attest-selenium-python
====================

attest-selenium-python integrates Attest HTML and selenium to enable automated web accessibility testing.

This project is a fork of the axe-selenium-python project, but uses Attest instead of Axe-core. Please see the sourced repo for more information: https://github.com/mozilla-services/axe-selenium-python.
